# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering algorithms. The dataset contains various features such as `TotalValue`, `Quantity`, `Region`, and more. The goal is to identify different customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

## Approach

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
   - Standardized numerical columns to ensure they are on the same scale before clustering.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performed various statistical analyses to understand the distribution and correlation of the features.
   - Visualized distributions, correlations, and outliers using plots.

### 3. **Clustering (KMeans)**
   - Applied KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customers into different groups.
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
   - Analyzed the cluster profiles to understand the characteristics of each customer group.

### 4. **Key Insights**
   - **Cluster 1**: Represents high-value customers who make frequent and high-value purchases.
   - **Cluster 2**: Represents low-value customers with occasional purchases.
   - **Cluster 3**: Represents moderate-value customers with consistent purchases.
   - Actionable recommendations based on these insights include targeted marketing campaigns for high-value clusters.
